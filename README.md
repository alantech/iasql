# Cloud infrastructure as data in PostgreSQL

[IaSQL](https://iasql.com) is open-source software that treats infrastructure as data by maintaining a 2-way connection between a cloud account and a PostgreSQL database.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Try out IaSQL

To connect your AWS account to a PostgreSQL database running locally make sure docker is installed and run:

```bash
docker run -p 9876:9876 -p 5432:5432 --name iasql iasql/iasql
```

Alternatively, use a hosted version of IaSQL at [app.iasql.com](https://app.iasql.com)

## üí¨ Community, Support and Questions

Reach out on Discord to:

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Providers

AWS is our main focus at the moment, but we plan to support GCP, Azure and other cloud providers soon. Let us know if you need a specific AWS service and we might be able to prioritize it!

### AWS coverage

An IaSQL module roughly maps to an AWS service. Check out our supported modules in this [part](https://iasql.com/docs/modules/) of our docs. 

AWS services that are going to be added next can be found [here](https://github.com/iasql/iasql/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22cloud+coverage%22). Let us know if you would like to see one that is not listed!
