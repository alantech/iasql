# Cloud infrastructure as data in PostgreSQL

[IaSQL](https://iasql.com) is an open-source developer tool to inspect and provision cloud infrastructure via SQL by maintaining a 2-way connection between an unmodified PostgreSQL database and your AWS account. The rows in the database tables represent the infrastructure in your cloud account.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Try out IaSQL

To get started with IaSQL using our documentation. Visit [iasql.com/docs](https://iasql.com/docs)

## üî® Use cases

- [Quickly setup ECR+ECS+ELB using our ejectable abstraction for those services](https://iasql.com/blog/ecs-simplified)
- [Save on AWS by deleting untagged ECR images](https://iasql.com/blog/ecr-save)
- [Deploy a static website](https://iasql.com/blog/deploy-static-website)
- [Save $ on public S3 buckets using VPC endpoints via SQL](https://iasql.com/blog/save-s3-vpc)
- [Securely connect to an Amazon RDS via PrivateLink](https://iasql.com/blog/rds-privatelink)

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Providers

AWS is our main focus at the moment, but we plan to support GCP, Azure, and other cloud providers soon. Let us know if you need a specific AWS service and we might be able to prioritize it!

### AWS coverage

An IaSQL module roughly maps to an AWS service. Check out our supported modules in this [part](https://iasql.com/docs/modules/) of our docs. 

AWS services that are going to be added next can be found [here](https://github.com/alantech/iasql/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22cloud+coverage%22). Let us know if you would like to see one that is not listed!
