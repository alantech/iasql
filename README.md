# Cloud infrastructure as data in PostgreSQL

[IaSQL](https://iasql.com) is open-source software that treats infrastructure as data by maintaining a 2-way connection between a cloud account and a PostgreSQL database.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Try out IaSQL

To connect your AWS account to a PostgreSQL database running locally make sure docker is installed and run:

```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 -p 8888:8888 --name iasql iasql/iasql
```

Alternatively, use a hosted version of IaSQL at [app.iasql.com](https://app.iasql.com)

## üí¨ Community, Support and Questions

Reach out on Discord to:
