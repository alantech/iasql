## Releases

For releases call the `../.release.sh` in the top level folder with the appropiate version passed as an argument. If we are on `0.1.31`, do `0.1.32`.

This will trigger the [CI job](https://github.com/alantech/iasql/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml). Once the GH CI action runs, you will see a release with that name [here](https://github.com/alantech/iasql/releases) in a few minutes in this [public repository](https://github.com/alantech/iasql-releases) since this repository is private.
