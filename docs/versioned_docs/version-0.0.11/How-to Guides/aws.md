# Manage an AWS Account

IaSQL requires cloud credentials to manage and provision resources which can be provided in one of two ways.

First, make sure you have an [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) in AWS or create one with **Programmatic access** through the [console/UI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console) or [CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_cliwpsapi). Ensure that the IAM role has sufficient permissions to deploy and manage all your infrastructure resources.

There are two parts to each [access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys), which youâ€™ll see in the IAM console/CLI after you create it, an id and a secret.

## View existing AWS CLI credentials

The [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) creates a plaintext credentials file on your machine that contains the AWS access keys that the CLI has access to. The file is named `credentials` and is located inside the `.aws/` directory in your home directory.

```bash
$ cat ~/.aws/credentials

[default]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

## Add the necessary cloud services to the hosted database

Connect to your database and use the `iasql_install` IaSQL PostgreSQL [function](/function) which is already loaded into your database to install different [modules](/module) and start managing different parts of your cloud account. Many different clients can be used to [connect](/connect) to a PostgreSQL database.

:::note

To see the available modules use the `modules_list` [function](/function) which will return a virtual table

:::

```sql
SELECT * from iasql_install(
   'aws_iam',
   'aws_cloudwatch',
   'aws_ecr',
   'aws_ecs_fargate',
   'aws_elb',
   'aws_security_group',
   'aws_vpc'
);
```
