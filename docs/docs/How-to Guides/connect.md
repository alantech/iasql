# Connecting to a database

PostgreSQL has a built-in command line client, `psql`, which you can use to connect to your database and run queries. To install `psql` in your command line follow the instructions for your corresponding OS [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

One of the reasons we built IaSQL on an unmodified PG is because of the vast ecosystem we get to stand on. This [PostgreSQL Client wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_Clients) contains an extensive list of all the different clients you can use to connect to a PG database provisioned with IaSQL.
