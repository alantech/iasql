# Import infrastructure

When you start managing your cloud account with an IaSQL DB after `iasql new`, all the existing infrastructure in the account is automatically added to the db. Once you start managing your infrastructure with an IaSQL db, `iasql import` can rollback infrastructure changes, or stand up test environments, from previously generated backups created using `iasql export`.
