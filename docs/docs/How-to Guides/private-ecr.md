# Publish a container image to a private repository in AWS ECR

If you are creating an ECS task that is hosted on AWS Fargate, or on an external instance, and is pulling a container image from an Amazon ECR private repository you will need to have a ECS execution role.

Follow these instructions to create one: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html

Once you create the role, make sure the `aws_ecr` module has been added to your database with `iasql install` and  pass the ECS role name when calling the `create_task_definition` [stored procedure](/proc) to create an ECS task definition.
