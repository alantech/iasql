# Code of Conduct

Welcome to the IaSQL Community! We are glad you want to participate *and* that you've taken the step to see what is tolerable behavior and what is not in our community.

Out of respect to you, as well, our code of conduct is brief and (we hope) clear:

1. We do not tolerate racism, sexism, homophobism, fascism, classism, and anti-intellectualism (such as anti-vaccine or flat earth beliefs). We believe that people are born equal and should be treated equally as long as they prescribe to that same notion. This solution to the ["Paradox of Tolerance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) maximizes the total number of people who can work together with minimal conflicts.
2. This community is primarily a place to advance and improve a technical product that is a solution to many developers' problems. We would prefer discussions on the injustices caused by the people excluded in the first point *not* occur here. There are many other forums for these discussions that can also be more productive there. Having a space where one can completely submerge themselves in technical problems and discussions can be *cathartic* for people who are affected by them and a much-needed reprieve. Lack of such discussion on those problems here is not lack of empathy for those affected by those problems.
3. Spamming is also not tolerated. It's counted separately since it is often not inherently malicious like the problems above, but spamming makes discussions more difficult by needing to wade through it.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at hello@iasql.com. It is at the discretion of the the project team on how to enforce this code of conduct. People make mistakes or could learn and become better people with proper guidance, so we will tend to delete the offensive content and reach out to first-time offenders. Repeat offenders may be banned from participating.
