// Mimicking `apt` in this due to the similarities in environment modules/packages are being managed
// within. Here's the list of commands `apt` itself claims are commonly used. Which should we
// support, and is there anything not present that we need to due to particulars of IaSQL? Maybe an
// "enable/disable" endpoint to stop actions for a given module (and anything dependent on it) but
// not removing it from the DB?
//
// Most used commands:
//  list - list packages based on package names
//  search - search in package descriptions
//  show - show package details
//  install - install packages
//  reinstall - reinstall packages
//  remove - remove packages
//  autoremove - Remove automatically all unused packages
//  update - update list of available packages
//  upgrade - upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages
//  full-upgrade - upgrade the system by removing/installing/upgrading packages
//  edit-sources - edit the source information file
//  satisfy - satisfy dependency strings
