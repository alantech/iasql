[IaSQL](https://iasql.com) is open-source software to inspect and provision cloud infrastructure via SQL by maintaining a 2-way connection between an unmodified PostgreSQL database and your AWS account. The rows in the database tables represent the infrastructure in your cloud account. 

### 1. Start the IaSQL container

To start the IaSQL container locally make sure docker is installed and run:

```bash
docker run --pull=always -p 9876:9876 -p 5432:5432 --name iasql iasql/iasql
```

Now simply open `http://localhost:9876` in your preferred browser to open the IaSQL dashboard.

### 2. Connect an AWS account

Click on the connect account button in the IaSQL dashboard which will open the modal displayed below and provide AWS credentials. Read more about how to manage your AWS account and generate credentials [here](./how-to/aws.mdx).

<ThemedImage
  alt="Dashboard"
  style={{border: '2px solid rgba(52, 52, 52, 0.1)', height: '40rem' }}
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/screenshots/connect.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/screenshots/connect_dark.png'),
  }}
/>


### 3. Install modules in the database

Which tables are loaded into an [IaSQL database](./concepts/db.md) is configured based on what [IaSQL modules](./concepts/module.md) are installed in a db. Every IaSQL module represents a cloud service like `aws_ec2` or `aws_elb`. Install the desired modules with the `install` [IaSQL PostgreSQL function](./modules/builtin/iasql_functions.md).

```sql
SELECT * FROM iasql_install('aws_ec2');
```

Or click `Install` in the dashboard module sidebar:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Dashboard"
  style={{border: '2px solid rgba(52, 52, 52, 0.1)' }}
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/screenshots/dashboard.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/screenshots/dashboard_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

:::note
The database is automatically backfilled with all your existing cloud resources during module installation which can take a few minutes depending on how many cloud resources exist in AWS service for the module being installed
:::

### 4. Inspect and provision infrastructure using SQL

Run `INSERT` or `UPDATE` queries on the database by using the IaSQL dashboard or any [PostgreSQL client](./how-to/postgres.mdx) using the PG connection string displayed at the end of step 2. IaSQL will push the changes in your database to the cloud. Below are some common use cases:

- [Quickly setup ECR+ECS+ELB using our ejectable abstraction for those services](https://iasql.com/blog/ecs-simplified)
- [Save on AWS by deleting untagged ECR images](https://iasql.com/blog/ecr-save)
- [Deploy a static website](https://iasql.com/blog/deploy-static-website)
- [Save $ on public S3 buckets using VPC endpoints](https://iasql.com/blog/save-s3-vpc)
- [Securely connect to an Amazon RDS via PrivateLink](https://iasql.com/blog/rds-privatelink)

### What part of the documentation should I look at?

A high-level overview of how the IaSQL documentation is organized will help you know how to quickly find what you are looking for:

- The [tutorials](/blog/tags/tutorial/) will take you through different examples that inspect and provision cloud resources using SQL. Start here if youâ€™re new to IaSQL.
- [How-to guides](./how-to/aws.mdx) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use cases. They are more advanced than the quickstart and assume some knowledge of how IaSQL works.
- [Concepts](./concepts/db.md) provides useful background and describes at a fairly high level the internals of how IaSQL works.
- Reference and code samples for IaSQL [modules](./modules/) describe how each module works and how to use it but assumes some knowledge of how IaSQL works.
