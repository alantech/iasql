Method that finishes a transaction. It is possible to perform changes to your cloud account synchronously by
temporarily turning off the normal two-way propagation between the cloud and database through the usage of an IaSQL
transaction using the provided PostgreSQL function `iasql_begin`. This lets you batch, or stage, changes together and
then calling `iasql_commit` to mark the end of the transaction and propagate the changes from the database to the cloud account.
