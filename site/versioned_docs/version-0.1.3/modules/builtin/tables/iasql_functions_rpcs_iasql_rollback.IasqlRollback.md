Method to abort an IaSQL transaction if you want to discard the changes done since calling `iasql_begin` by
calling `iasql_rollback`. This will sync from your cloud and re-enable regular behaviour of IaSQL in which changes are propagated
both ways in an eventually consistent way without any special syntax other than
`SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` records normally.

Returns following columns:
- action: The action issued in the db
- table_name: Table that was affected
- id: the ID of the generated change
- description: A description of the generated change
