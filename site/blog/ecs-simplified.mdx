If you have ever tried to deploy your containerized application to ECS, you know that it's not going to be an easy click-to-deploy journey. In order to get your application up and running on ECS, you have to go through a bunch of resource creation. You'll need to:
- Deploy a load balancer as the point-of-contact for your app
- Create a target group for the load balancer and register the ECS tasks in it
- Add a new listener to your load balancer and connect it to the target group
- Create a security group, and you need to allow the port your app is listening on in that security group
- Attach the security group above to your load balancer
- Create a CloudWatch log group for your ECS task
- Create an ECS cluster, and definitely the task definition as well
- Oh, and create an ECR repository to push your images to be run on the container

I'm not going to continue this long list, since I've already got a headache. Doing those steps manually is going to give you a headache as well, so why bother doing all those steps yourself and risking different errors you might face when deploying your containerized app? You don't really have the time for the random IAM-related errors AWS is demanding you to resolve. Besides, you already have your codebase ready and the `Dockerfile` is there, so why not just run a simple command doing something that should be simply done?

In this post, we're going to discover an IaSQL module that's built to make deploying to ECS, simplified. Most of the details for deploying a container to ECS are the same (load balancers, security groups, IAM roles, etc), and we have created the `ecs_simplified` module for you so that you can give it any Github repo with a `Dockerfile` and get your app deployed to ECS in the fastest time possible, with scalability available! All the needed resources are going to be created automatically in your AWS account, and you'll have the full access to the details while you're gaining the benefit of a higher-level simple deployment.

## ** An Example of `aws_ecs_simplified` Module **

Let's say we are going to deploy [this simple Express.js app](https://github.com/iasql/iasql-engine/tree/main/examples/ecs-fargate/prisma/app) to the ECS. It has a `Dockerfile` ready which `npm install`s the `express` package and then starts the Express server which listens on the port `8088`.

:::note
`aws_ecs_simplified` is a high-level module we have created to make scalable ECS deployments easier. For more info on the high-level vs low-level modules, you can check [this guide](https://iasql.com/docs/high-level-vs-low-level/).
:::

Assuming that you have an IaSQL database, let's go and deploy the above app to our AWS account.
```sql title="Deploy a simple Express.js app from a Github repository to ECS" showLineNumbers TheButton="Deploy Now"
SELECT iasql_install('aws_ecs_simplified');
INSERT INTO ecs_simplified(app_name, app_port, image_tag, public_ip) VALUES(
  'simple-express',
  8088,
  'latest',
  true
);
SELECT iasql_apply();

SELECT ecr_build(
  'https://github.com/iasql/iasql-engine/', -- the Github repo URL
  (SELECT id
    FROM repository
    WHERE repository_name = 'simple-express-repository')::varchar(255), -- ECR repo for the image to be pushed
  './examples/ecs-fargate/prisma/app', -- the subdirectory in Github repo
  'main', -- the Github branch or ref
  NULL -- Github personal access token - can be omitted if public repository
);
```
That's it! Now wait for some time and your app is deployed! While your app is being deployed, let's go through the commands we executed in more depth:
```sql
SELECT iasql_install('aws_ecs_simplified');
```
- This command installs the `aws_ecs_simplified` high-level module. We– at IaSQL– have created that module to make it easy to deploy containerized apps to ECS. But IaSQL is so flexible that anyone can create their own high-level (and of course, low-level) modules and add it to IaSQL.
```sql
INSERT INTO ecs_simplified(app_name, app_port, image_tag, public_ip) VALUES(
  'simple-express',
  8088,
  'latest',
  true
);
```
- This command creates a new `ecs_simplified` app by inserting a new row into the `ecs_simplified` table. Seems pretty easy, right? But under the hood, it's creating all the necessary resources like load balancers, security groups, IAM roles, etc.
  - You can manually check the tables to see what resources are being created. For example, looking at the `load_balancer` table you'll see a load balancer named `simple-express-load-balancer` is inserted automatically by running the above insert command.
```sql
SELECT iasql_apply();
```
- The insert command did create the list for what resources should be created, but they've not yet created on the AWS. You need to call the `iasql_apply()` function to sync the cloud with the data on your database.
  - For more info on the `iasql_apply()` command, check [this guide](https://iasql.com/docs/apply-and-sync/#apply-and-preview_apply) on how it works.
- After running the `iasql_apply()` function to completion all the necessary resources are now created on the cloud, so their ARNs are populated. You can verify this by looking at different tables, eg. `iam_role`.
- To get your load balancer address, you can easily run `SELECT load_balancer_dns FROM ecs_simplified WHERE app_name = 'simple-express'` query and get the URL to access your app.
- Now the ECS is waiting for an image to be pushed to your ECR repository to run it. You can get the URI for the ECR repository by running the `SELECT repository_uri FROM ecs_simplified WHERE app_name = 'simple-express'` query.  You *could* build your docker image locally and then follow [Steps 2 and 4 from this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/getting-started-cli.html) to connect your local docker CLI to your ECR repository and push that docker image into your ECR repository, but we have a simpler solution next.
  - In the next step, we'll automatically build an image for the code in Github repo and then push it to this URI (all through SQL and using another high-level function named `ecr_build`).
```sql
SELECT ecr_build(
  'https://github.com/iasql/iasql-engine/', -- the Github repo URL
  (SELECT id
    FROM repository
    WHERE repository_name = 'simple-express-repository')::varchar(255), -- ECR repo for the image to be pushed
  './examples/ecs-fargate/prisma/app', -- the subdirectory in Github repo
  'main',  -- the Github branch or ref
  NULL -- Github personal access token - can be omitted if public repository
);
```
- This command tells IaSQL to go clone `iasql-engine` repository, build an image on the subdirectory specified, and then push it to the ECR repository created earlier by `ecs_simplified` module. Running the above command will automatically create a CodeBuild project and the related roles, etc. Then it'll start a build, and after it's successful all the created resources are deleted to ensure there won't be any additional charges to your AWS account.
- To access your app on the cloud, get the load balancer address and use your browser to access the live version of it:
```sql
SELECT load_balancer_dns
FROM ecs_simplified
WHERE app_name = 'simple-express';
```
Then you can check if the server is running on the `url:8088/health` address.

## Low-level Access to Resources

So the `aws_ecs_simplified` module simplifies things, right? But what if you still want the level of control you had when you were doing all the steps manually? You can't grow your app beyond limitations if you don't have access to all the small details. Let's say you want your ECS container to be able to use the AWS CLI to provision an EC2 instance, and for that purpose its IAM role needs `AmazonEC2FullAccess` policy to work properly. `aws_ecs_simplifiy` is good, but wasn't it better if we could just manage the lower-level details as well?

The good news is that you still have the full control over all resources in the deepest details. Let's fix your app's IAM role access by attaching the needed policy to its IAM role:
```sql
UPDATE iam_role
SET attached_policies_arns = attached_policies_arns ||
                             'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess' -- attached_policies_arns is of text[] type
WHERE role_name = 'simple-express-ecs-task-exec-role';

```

You want additional rules for the container's security group? No problem! just write the SQL and execute it, and it will be applied to the cloud within seconds. You want 3 copies of your container to be kept running with a round-robin load balancing on them? It's already there, just do an `UPDATE ecs_simplified SET desired_count = 3 WHERE app_name = 'simple_express';` and it's there for you.

With IaSQL and thanks to its flexibility, you can benefit from both the high-level and low-level operations. We have created `aws_ecs_simplified` module to show the flexibility and power of IaSQL engine, but the possibilities are endless, and we are an open-source project meaning that you can use the powerful IaSQL engine and build your modules on top of that.
