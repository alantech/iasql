In this post, we will deploy a NodeJS server that is hosted on Github to AWS using an EC2 instance and CodePipeline. We will do this using IaSQL. 

<!-- truncate -->
IaSQL is an [open-source](https://github.com/alantech/iasql) software tool that creates a two-way connection between an unmodified PostgreSQL database and an AWS account so you can manage your infrastructure from a database.

## What is CodePipeline?

[CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) is an AWS service that provides a fully automated [Continuous Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) service.
It allows you to fully manage all the steps in the code delivery lifecycle, from checking out, building, testing, and deploying source code.
The whole process is managed by CodePipeline using specific configuration files without manual intervention, offering a safe and reliable way to deploy to the cloud.
The following example will showcase the automated build and deployment of a NodeJS app from a Github repository to an EC2 instance that exposes the app with an elastic IP address.
The testing part is intentionally not covered by this post, but would be an important part to cover when deploying to production.

## The NodeJS application

In this example, we are going to build and deploy a very simple NodeJS application, that simply will output **Hello World!** to the browser.
The application will be served to port 80 by Nginx, that will be acting as a reverse proxy for the node app.
The application is hosted on a [public github repository](https://github.com/iasql/iasql-code-example-node).

The instructions for building and deploying the application are defined in the [`appspec.yml`](https://github.com/iasql/iasql-code-example-node/blob/main/appspec.yml) file.
This file contains all the information needed by CodeDeploy to manage the whole lifecycle of the application
:::note
Complete reference can be seen
at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file-example.html#appspec-file-example-server
:::.

This sample configuration is divided in two steps: **files** and **hooks**.
**Files** section allows you to specify where to copy the contents of the application. The contents of this application are divided between main content of the app, and specific nginx configuration.
**Hooks** section allows you to define scripts to tackle every step of the app's lifecycle. In this example the following steps are covered:

- BeforeInstall: script to install all needed dependencies to run the application. It is used to install all packages and dependencies
- AfterInstall: script triggered to offer the possibility of updating the application configuration before it starts
- ApplicationStart: script that is actually managing the start of the application, with command like `npm start`

For this specific example the application will be the deployed into an EC2 instance, and content will be exposed via the **public ip**.
Additional steps such as using Autoscaling groups, or Load Balancers would improve the availability of the application, but are not covered on this post.

## Pre-requisites

The source code and configuration of this sample is using GitHub on the IaSQL organization account.
In order to run the example, please fork the https://github.com/iasql/iasql-code-example-node repository under an account you can control, as it needs some additional permissions to connect with AWS CodePipeline.

Next step is to grant AWS permissions to the forked repo. One way of doing that is by using [personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
Please follow this documentation to create the token and ensure that the token has **repo** and **repo_hook** permissions. Copy the generated token, as it will be used later when configuring the pipeline.

## Initial steps

Before actually creating the deployment pipeline, we need to install several dependencies in IaSQL to be able to install, deploy and serve the application. The following installation script will cover those steps:

```sql title="Install CodePipeline dependencies"
 -- installs needed modules
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_install ('aws_codepipeline', 'aws_s3', 'aws_ec2_metadata');

SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_begin ();

    "Service": "codepipeline.amazonaws.com"
  },
  "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
}
]
}',
    ARRAY[
      'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCodePipeline_FullAccess',
      'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess',
      'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCodeDeployFullAccess'
    ]
  );

-- create bucket for storing code artifacts
INSERT INTO
  bucket (NAME)
VALUES
  ('codedeploy-app-iasql');

-- create security group for the EC2 instances
INSERT INTO
  security_group (description, group_name)
VALUES
  ('CodedeploySecurity Group', 'codedeploy');

INSERT INTO
  security_group_rule (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description, security_group_id)
SELECT
  FALSE,
  'tcp',

  '0.0.0.0/0',
  'codedeploy_rule_ssh',
  id
FROM
  security_group
WHERE
  group_name = 'codedeploy';

INSERT INTO
  security_group_rule (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description, security_group_id)
SELECT
  FALSE,
  'tcp',
  80,

SELECT
  TRUE,
  'tcp',
  1,
  65335,
  '0.0.0.0/0',
  'codedeploy_rule_egress',
  id
FROM
  security_group
WHERE
  group_name = 'codedeploy';

-- spin up an Ubuntu EC2 instance with codedeploy_agent_install preinstalled
INSERT INTO
  instance (ami, instance_type, tags, subnet_id, role_name, user_data)
SELECT
  'resolve:ssm:/aws/service/canonical/ubuntu/server/20.04/stable/current/amd64/hvm/ebs-gp2/ami-id',
  't2.micro',
  '{"name":"codedeploy-app"}',
  id,
  'ec2_role',
  (
    SELECT
      generate_codedeploy_agent_install_script ('us-east-1', 'ubuntu')
  )
FROM
  subnet
WHERE
  availability_zone = 'us-east-1a'
LIMIT
  1;

INSERT INTO
  instance_security_groups (instance_id, security_group_id)
SELECT
  (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      instance
    WHERE
      tags ->> 'name' = 'codedeploy-app'
  ),
  (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      security_group
    WHERE
      group_name = 'codedeploy'
  );

SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_commit ();
```

This fragment will install the required modules, and all the infrastructure needed to deploy the pipeline, including the needed Roles, Security Rules, Storage and Compute on EC2. After this process finishes, the pipeline is ready to go. It can be launched in another query (please remember to replace the _token_ with your current one):

```sql title="Trigger CodePipeline"
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_begin ();

-- create initial codedeploy application
INSERT INTO
  codedeploy_application (NAME, compute_platform)
VALUES
  ('codedeploy-app', 'Server');

-- create deployment group for deploying the application to the associated instances
INSERT INTO
  codedeploy_deployment_group (application_id, NAME, role_name, ec2_tag_filters)
VALUES
  (
    (
      SELECT
        id
      FROM
        codedeploy_application
      WHERE
        NAME = 'codedeploy-app'
    ),
    'dg-name',
    'codedeploy_role',
    '[

"Type": "KEY_AND_VALUE",
"Key": "name",
"Value": "codedeploy-app"
}

  );

-- create pipeline to download source code and deploy it
INSERT INTO
  pipeline_declaration (NAME, service_role_name, stages, artifact_store)
VALUES

    '

        },
        "outputArtifacts": [
          {

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  {

    "actions": [

        "configuration": {
          "ApplicationName": "codedeploy-app",
          "DeploymentGroupName": "dg-name"
        },
        "inputArtifacts": [
          {
            "name": "Source"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]',
    '{ "type": "S3", "location": "codedeploy-app-iasql" }'
  );

SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_commit ();
```

This pipeline is describing all the needed steps to deploy the application:

- **Source** defines where to pick the source code from, and where to store it. It will pick from the defined GitHub repo, and it will store on the S3 bucket defined in the artifact configuration
- **Deploy** defines the action to take. It will trigger a deployment based on the created application and the specific deployment group.

The status of the pipeline can be checked via AWS console:

<img src="/img/codepipeline_status.png" style={{ maxWidth: 600 }} />

After a small amount of time the pipeline will run and the application will be ready to go. It will be exposed on the EC2 public ip, that can be extracted with:

```sql title="Get public IP"
SELECT
  public_ip_address
FROM
  instance_metadata
WHERE
  id = (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      instance
    WHERE
      tags ->> 'name' = 'codedeploy-app'
  );
```

Then please check that the application runs successfully in your browser by visiting `http://<public_ip_address>`:
