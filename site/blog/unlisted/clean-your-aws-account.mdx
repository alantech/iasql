# Clean your AWS account with a SQL query

One of the main complexities of working with AWS is the number of resources that can be created, either by manual or automated workflows. The chained resources and their dependencies can quickly get out of control,
and it could be a nightmare to clean up then.

This is a common problem when using test accounts, either for developing or testing some integrations. Often these accounts have resources out of control, causing extra costs, or unexpected conflicts.
Cleaning those manually can be a hard task... manually visiting each resource, investigating the dependencies, manually cleaning... it is a time-consuming, error-prone task. If we consider that those resources may be created in
multiple regions, the manual procedure can become a very difficult task.

To solve this problem you can use a tool like [AWS Nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke) or IaSQL. IaSQL is a tool that lets you manage your cloud account using a PostgreSQL database. IaSQL will backfill a PostgreSQL database with the contents of your cloud and then you can run a query that schedules the deletion of the existing resources and their dependencies until your account is completely cleaned.

**Want to try? Connect your AWS account to [IaSQL](https://iasql.com) for free. Read more about AWS account management in this part of our [docs](/docs/manage_aws/).**

:::info

Please note that IaSQL can offer this cleanup only for the resources covered by our system. You can get a full coverage list in this [part](/docs/modules/) of our docs. AWS services that are going to be added next can be found [here](https://github.com/alantech/iasql/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22cloud+coverage%22). Let us know if you would like to see an AWS service or feature that is not listed!

```sql
-- Install all IaSQL modules
SELECT iasql_install(variadic array(select module_name from iasql_modules_list()));
SELECT iasql_begin();
-- Delete all resources from the db
SELECT * FROM delete_all_records();
-- See the changes that are going to be applied
SELECT iasql_preview();
-- Rollback the changes
SELECT iasql_rollback();
-- To apply the changes please uncomment the following line (and comment the rollback statement) to perform the cleanup
-- SELECT iasql_commit();
```

After the initial module install, IaSQL will inspect your cloud and propose the resources to delete.
If you agree with the proposed changes, uncomment the `commit` statement, comment the `rollback` statement, and run the SQL query again. This time IaSQL will completely clean up your account.
