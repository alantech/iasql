# Advanced configuration for deploying <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> on EC2

In our previous [blog post](/blog/deploy-ghost-ec2) we went through how to install <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> in an EC2 instance, using a simple configuration. While it is ok
for testing and development purposes, it was not ready for production. To be ready, it needs some essential features, which we will be illustrating in this new post.

## Associate a domain

The initial deployment was just serving Ghost on the public IP of the instance, which is something not suitable for end use. As an initial step, we will be associating that instance with a domain.
To achieve that, we will be relying on AWS Route 53 to create hosted zones and recordsets, and associate them to the instance:

```sql title="Generate A record for domain"
 -- Install modules
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_install ('aws_route53', 'aws_ec2_metadata');

-- Grab public IP for previously created instance
SELECT
  public_ip_address
FROM
  instance_metadata
WHERE
  id = (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      instance
    WHERE
      tags ->> 'name' = 'ghost-blog'
    LIMIT
      1
  );

-- Create recordset
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_begin ();

INSERT INTO
  hosted_zone (domain_name)
VALUES
  ('test-ghost.com.');

INSERT INTO
  resource_record_set (NAME, parent_hosted_zone_id, record_type, record, ttl)
SELECT
  'blog.test-ghost.com.',
  id,
  'A',
  '<instance_public_ip>',
  300
FROM
  hosted_zone
WHERE
  domain_name = 'test-ghost.com.';

SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_commit ();
```

After waiting for some time, and assuming that the domain nameservers are pointing to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-in-use.html#migrate-dns-change-name-servers-with-provider">AWS nameservers</a>,
the `blog.test-ghost.com` subdomain should be resolved to the EC2 instance IP.

Finally, Ghost needs to be configured to serve this new domain. This can be achieved by connecting by SSH to the instance:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<instance_public_ip>
sudo su ghostuser
cd /var/www/ghost
ghost config url http://blog.test-ghost.com
ghost setup nginx
ghost restart
```

## Serve traffic over HTTPS

The current deployment is served as HTTP, something not really suitable for production, where all traffic needs to be served via HTTPS. In order to achieve that, we can request a certificate for the
domain using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager">AWS ACM</a> functionality. The certificate will be validated automatically using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html">DNS method</a>:

```sql title="Request certificate and validate via DNS"
 -- Install modules
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_install ('aws_acm');

-- request certificate
SELECT
  *
FROM
  certificate_request ('test-ghost.com', 'DNS', 'us-east-2', '');
```

The DNS method is performed automagically in IaSQL if the domain is managed via Route 53 service. As an alternative, manual validation can be issued via this method, or e-mail.
In the e-mail case, a validation link will be sent to the associated e-mail for the domain. The certificate will be activated by manually clicking on the activation link:

```sql title="Request certificate and validate via email"
 -- Install modules
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_install ('aws_acm');

-- request certificate
SELECT
  *
FROM
  certificate_request ('test-ghost.com', 'EMAIL', 'us-east-2', '');
```

Once the certificate has been properly issued, it needs to be associated with the current EC2 instance. This is achieved by creating a

<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Load Balancer</a> - application, internet facing - and properly
associating the certificate and domain:

```sql title="Create Load Balancer"
 -- Install modules
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_install ('aws_elb');

-- create components
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_begin ();

INSERT INTO
  load_balancer (load_balancer_name, scheme, vpc, load_balancer_type, ip_address_type)
VALUES
  ('ghost', 'internet-facing', NULL, 'application', 'ipv4');

INSERT INTO
  load_balancer_security_groups (load_balancer_id, security_group_id)
SELECT
  (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      load_balancer
    WHERE
      load_balancer_name = 'ghost'
  ),
  (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      security_group
    WHERE
      group_name = 'ghost_sg'
  );

INSERT INTO
  target_group (target_group_name, target_type, protocol, port)
VALUES
  ('ghost', 'instance', 'HTTP', 80);

INSERT INTO
  listener (load_balancer_id, port, protocol, target_group_id, action_type, certificate_id)
VALUES
  (
    (
      SELECT
        id
      FROM
        load_balancer
      WHERE
        load_balancer_name = 'ghost'
    ),
    443,
    'HTTPS',
    (
      SELECT
        id
      FROM
        target_group
      WHERE
        target_group_name = 'ghost'
    ),
    'forward',
    (
      SELECT
        id
      FROM
        certificate
      WHERE
        domain_name = 'test-ghost.com'
    )
  );

SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_commit ();
```

Once the ALB is created, we will associate the Ghost EC2 instance with the matching target group:

```sql title="Associate instance to target group"
 -- register ec2 instance
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_begin ();

INSERT INTO
  registered_instance (instance, target_group_id)
SELECT
  (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      instance
    WHERE
      tags ->> 'name' = 'ghost-blog'
  ),
  (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      target_group
    WHERE
      target_group_name = 'ghost'
  );

SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_commit ();
```

The final step is to point the domain to the load balancer that has been created. If the domain is managed via Route 53 it
can be setup automatically:

```sql title="Delete old recordset"
 -- delete old recordset
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_begin ();

DELETE FROM
  resource_record_set
WHERE
  NAME = 'blog.test-ghost.com.';

SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_commit ();
```

```sql title="Create recordset"
 -- create alias recordset
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_begin ();

INSERT INTO
  alias_target (evaluate_target_health, load_balancer_id)
SELECT
  TRUE,
  id
FROM
  load_balancer
WHERE
  load_balancer_name = 'ghost'
LIMIT
  1;

INSERT INTO
  resource_record_set (NAME, record_type, alias_target_id, parent_hosted_zone_id)
VALUES
  (
    'blog.test-ghost.com.',
    'A',
    (
      SELECT
        id
      FROM
        alias_target
      WHERE
        load_balancer_id = (
          SELECT
            id
          FROM
            load_balancer
          WHERE
            load_balancer_name = 'ghost'
        )
      LIMIT
        1
    ),
    (
      SELECT
        id
      FROM
        hosted_zone
      WHERE
        domain_name = 'test-ghost.com.'
      LIMIT
        1
    )
  );

SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_commit ();
```

If the domain is managed externally, please create an A record with the domain of the blogpost, pointing to the DNS name of the created Load Balancer.

After the components have been created and instance properly associated, the Ghost configuration can be changed accordingly:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<instance_public_ip>
sudo su ghostuser
cd /var/www/ghost
ghost config url https://blog.test-ghost.com
ghost setup nginx
ghost restart
```

## Use an AWS managed database

The current approach was using an internal mySQL database hosted on the same EC2 instance. This could lead to unstability and availability problems,
depending on the traffic and capacity of the hosting EC2 instances. A more recommendable approach could be to use an externally
managed AWS database. We can rely on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">AWS RDS</a> for it.

```sql title="Create database"
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_begin ();

-- create security group and rules
INSERT INTO
  security_group (description, group_name)
VALUES
  ('RDS security Group', 'rds');

INSERT INTO
  security_group_rule (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description, security_group_id)
SELECT
  FALSE,
  'tcp',
  3306,
  3306,
  '0.0.0.0/0',
  'rds_mysql',
  id
FROM
  security_group
WHERE
  group_name = 'rds';

-- create database
INSERT INTO
  rds (
    db_instance_identifier,
    allocated_storage,
    db_instance_class,
    engine,
    master_user_password,
    master_username,
    availability_zone
  )
VALUES
  ('ghost', 20, 'db.t3.micro', 'mysql', 'admin2022', 'admin', 'us-east-2a');

INSERT INTO
  rds_security_groups (rds_id, security_group_id)
SELECT
  (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      rds
    WHERE
      db_instance_identifier = 'ghost'
  ),
  (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      security_group
    WHERE
      group_name = 'rds'
      AND region = 'us-east-2'
  );

SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_commit ();
```

Once the database has been created, the endpoint and ports can be retrieved, so they can be connected to the Ghost instance:

```sql title="Retrieve database details"
SELECT
  endpoint_addr,
  endpoint_port
FROM
  rds;
```

The database can be associated via Ghost configuration. Then the local database can be removed:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<instance_public_ip>
sudo su ghostuser
cd /var/www/ghost
ghost config set database.client mysql
ghost config set database.connection.host <endpoint_addr>
ghost config set database.connection.user admin
ghost config set database.connection.password admin2022
ghost config set database.connection.port <endpoint_port>
ghost config set database.connection.database ghost
ghost config set database.connection.charset utf8
ghost config set database.connection.ssl "Amazon RDS"
ghost restart
```

** With all these additions, your Ghost deployment will be suitable for production, being able to manage traffic securely and reliably. **
