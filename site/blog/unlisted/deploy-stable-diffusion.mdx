# Deploy <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release">Stable Diffusion</a> to AWS with one click

Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt.

There is a publicly available <a href="https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream">tool</a> , it is limited to a maximum of 200 images generation. But because the model is open source, you can download and host your own version of it. There are different approaches to host it, butone easy option is to host in an EC2 GPU instance, using IaSQL to install with one SQL query.
IaSQL is an [open-source](https://github.com/iasql/iasql) software tool that creates a two-way connection between an unmodified PostgreSQL database and an AWS account so you can manage your infrastructure from a database.

## Pre-requisites

Stable Diffusion will need to run on GPU instances. These are likely not enabled in your AWS account by default, so you may need to increase your quota. This post uses _p_ instances, so you need to check your quota on <a href="https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/ec2/quotas">AWS</a> for the region where you want to deploy your model, and check if you have quota for this type. There is a need of 8 vCPUs per instance, so please request 8 vCPUS per each instance you want to deploy. As instances will take some time to terminate while other is started, it is recommended to request quota for at least 2 instances.

In order to run the model, there is the need to integrate with Nvidia GPU. This does not come out of the box, and needs to have a custom OS image with drivers installed. This is not a trivial process, but there are some AMIs in the marketplace that can help us with that. This post uses an image from marketplace, so a subscription will be needed in order to use it.
Please visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-64e4rx3h733ru?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWS-Marketplace-Console">AWS marketplace</a> and subscribe to the Amazon Linux 2 AMI with NVIDIA TESLA GPU Driver AMI offer.

**Please note that you will incur in a cost of $3.06/Hour when using this AMI**

## Stable Diffusion installation

While Stable Diffusion is a complex model with lots of dependencies, there are pre-built Docker images from the community that ship with all the components on place. We will rely on <a href="https://sygil-dev.github.io/sygil-webui/docs/Installation/docker-guide">Sygil WebUI</a> images to deploy our model. These images are ready to be used out of the box, but there is possibility to build and customize the images in case it's needed.

We would need to start by getting the AMI ID for the image on the marketplace, in order to boot images based on that. We can get it with a simple query using IaSQL SDK module:

```sql title="Get AMI ID"
 -- install modules
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_install ('aws_sdk');

-- query for the image based on the image description
SELECT
  invoke_ec2 (
    'describeImages',
    '{"Filters": [{"Name": "description", "Values": ["Amazon Linux 2 Graphics AMI 2.0.20230119.1 x86_64 HVM gp2"]}, {"Name": "architecture", "Values": ["x86_64"]}]}'
  ) -> 'Images' -> -1 -> 'ImageId';
```

Now with all pre-requisites solved, deploying Stable Diffusion can be done with one click using IaSQL engine. Please note that we will be using a beef p3.2xlarge instance with extra disk space storage, so running this experiment will incur in some extra costs:

```sql title="Deploy Stable Diffusion"
 -- install modules
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_install ('aws_ec2', 'aws_ec2_metadata');

-- start transaction
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_begin ();

-- set us-east-2 region as default to use it for all the resources in the deployment

  is_default = FALSE;

      (TRUE, 'tcp', 1, 65535, '0.0.0.0/0', 'stable_diffusion_sg_rule_egress')

## Accessing Stable Diffusion

The installation procedure will run totally unattended and will take over 10-15 minutes, due to the volume of the artifacts to install. After the process finishes you will have your Stable Diffusion web interface up and running, publicly accessible through the public IP of the spinned instance.
You can get the details of the public IP of your instance querying for the metadata:

```sql
SELECT
  public_ip_address
FROM
  instance_metadata
WHERE
  id = (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      instance
    WHERE
      tags ->> 'name' = 'stable-diffusion-blog'
    LIMIT
      1
  );
```

The initial Stable Diffusion installation will be available on the browser just query by `http://<public_ip_address>/`:

Time to enjoy your image generation and start being creative with Stable Diffusion!
