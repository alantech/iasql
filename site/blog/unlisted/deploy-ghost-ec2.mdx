# Deploy <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> to AWS with a SQL query

Ghost is a powerful app for new-media creators to publish, share, and grow a business around their content. It comes with modern tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters & offer paid
subscriptions to members.

Ghost is a software-as-a-service product, but it is built totally on open source and offers a self-hosted, self-serve version. The self-serve version can be hosted on AWS using several approaches.

One of them is starting an EC2 instance and manually triggering the installation commands is a procedure that can be done manually, but there are also other dependencies involved, such as the creation of proper security groups, load balancer, etc.
It is a time-consuming task, especially if you need to install several instances. This article will offer a way to install Ghost with one click on IaSQL using an EC2 instance on Ubuntu as highlighted <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/">here</a>. IaSQL is an [open-source](https://github.com/iasql/iasql) software tool that creates a two-way connection between an unmodified PostgreSQL database and an AWS account so you can manage your infrastructure from a database.

\_This approach uses <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html">EC2 user data</a> functionality - to run a startup script that will configure Ghost
as soon as the instance is started - and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html">EC2 instance metadata</a> - to retrieve
the public IP of the instance, and assign it dynamically to Ghost installation script.

## Pre-requisites

This post is going to rely on EC2 to install the Ghost content. To access the instance, it is recommended to set up an SSH key, to be able to access it later for modifications and maintenance. So we will be generating some keys
and importing them to later associate with the EC2 instance. If you do not have an existing key, please generate one. The output of the public key will be the one imported into the system:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /tmp/key
PUBKEY=$(cat /tmp/key.pub)
```

The public key will be then imported into the system:

```sql title="Import keypair"
 -- Install modules
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_install ('aws_ec2', 'aws_ec2_metadata');

-- Request a keypair
SELECT
  *
FROM
  key_pair_import ('ghost', '<your_pubkey_content>', 'us-east-2');
```

## Ghost installation

After the keypair has been imported, we can proceed with the installation of the instance itself, associating the created key to allow SSH access after it is created.

```sql title="Install Ghost"
 -- start transaction
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_begin ();

-- insert security groups
INSERT INTO
  security_group (description, group_name)
VALUES
  ('Ghost security group', 'ghost_sg');

INSERT INTO
  security_group_rule (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description, security_group_id)
SELECT
  t.is_egress,
  t.ip_protocol,
  t.from_port,
  t.to_port,
  t.cidr_ipv4::cidr,
  t.description,
  security_group.id
FROM
  security_group,
  (
    VALUES
      (FALSE, 'tcp', 22, 22, '0.0.0.0/0', 'ghost_sg_rule_ssh'),
      (FALSE, 'tcp', 80, 80, '0.0.0.0/0', 'ghost_sg_rule_http'),
      (FALSE, 'tcp', 443, 443, '0.0.0.0/0', 'ghost_sg_rule_https'),
      (TRUE, 'tcp', 1, 65535, '0.0.0.0/0', 'ghost_sg_rule_egress')
  ) AS t (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description)
WHERE
  security_group.group_name = 'ghost_sg';

-- insert instance with the right userdata
INSERT INTO

SELECT

    WHERE
      group_name = 'ghost_sg'
      AND region = 'us-east-2'
    LIMIT
      1
  );

SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_commit ();
```

## Accessing Ghost

After the process finishes (it will take over 10-15 minutes), you will have your Ghost instance installed, publicly accessible through the public IP of the spinned instance.
You can get the details of the public IP of your instance querying for the metadata:

```sql
SELECT
  public_ip_address
FROM
  instance_metadata
WHERE
  id = (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      instance
    WHERE
      tags ->> 'name' = 'ghost-blog'
    LIMIT
      1
  );
```

The initial Ghost installation will be available on the browser just query by `http://<public_ip_address>/ghost`:

This is the basic installation of Ghost, but it is just meant for development and testing purposes. Once you are satisfied with the setup,
you can continue to an advanced deployment of Ghost meant for production. This will come in a follow-up post from IaSQL.
