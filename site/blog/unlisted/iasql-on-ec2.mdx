This is the first in a series of blog posts on deploying different services to AWS using IaSQL. IaSQL covers a wide range of AWS services, so there are lots of different services with different architectures to explore. Deploying containers to ECS, launching servers using EC2, and use AWS Codepipeline to automate the building and deploying your applications are just a few possibilities.

In this post we'll explore how to deploy IaSQL on EC2, using IaSQL!

<!-- truncate -->

### Start IaSQL
To manage the cloud resources for your deployment of IaSQL, we'll need to use a separate instance of IaSQL locally via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/):

```bash
docker run -p 9876:9876 -p 5432:5432 --name iasql iasql/iasql
```
This will download the latest [IaSQL image from dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/iasql/iasql) and run it. After it's ready, you can access the dashboard at the following URL:

```
http://localhost:9876
```

<ThemedImage
  alt="IaSQL dashboard"
  style={{ width: '440' }}
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/iasql-on-ec2/dashboard.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/iasql-on-ec2/dashboard_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Now you can connect your AWS account in the dashboard. This will create a new database that can be connected using any Postgres client you prefer, or you may run queries directly through the dashboard.

### Deploy IaSQL on EC2 with IaSQL

#### Overview
To deploy IaSQL on EC2, we need to:

- Launch an EC2 instance that will host IaSQL
- Set the instance user data so that Docker will be installed upon instance launch, and the IaSQL container will be started
- Import an SSH key pair into AWS to be able to access the EC2 instance afterwards
- Set a security group for the instance to allow SSH, while disallowing unauthorized access to the dashboard


#### Install IaSQL Modules

Let's start by installing the needed IaSQL modules. IaSQL has a modular design, and therefore to manage EC2 instances, we need to use [`aws_ec2` module](https://iasql.com/docs/modules/aws/aws_ec2/). Also, [`aws_ec2_metadata`](https://iasql.com/docs/modules/aws/aws_ec2_metadata/) allows us to get more info on our EC2 instance, like its public IP.
```sql
SELECT iasql_install('aws_ec2', 'aws_ec2_metadata');
```

:::note
The above query can also be written like `SELECT * FROM iasql_install()`. The difference is that when doing `SELECT *`, the result will be in a table while the raw `SELECT` would put the result into Python-tuple-like rows. If you don't want to inspect the output of a query, it might be easier to follow the shorter query.
:::

#### Import SSH Key Pair Into AWS

Having SSH access to the instance is important, since if you don't have access to the instance you won't be able to upgrade the running IaSQL container. To enable SSH access, you can import your public key into AWS by executing the following IaSQL RPC:
```sql
SELECT * FROM key_pair_import('iasql', '<your-public-key-content>', default_aws_region());
```

This will direct IaSQL to create an [AWS key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html#how-to-generate-your-own-key-and-import-it-to-aws) with the name `iasql` in the `us-east-1` region, and with your public key contents.

:::note
An IaSQL RPC is a function available in Postgres that upon calling, sends a request to the IaSQL engine to run a pre-defined logic and returns results to the Postgres console. In the above example [`key_pair_import`](https://iasql.com/docs/modules/aws/tables/aws_ec2_rpcs_import.KeyPairImportRpc/) is an IaSQL RPC that triggers the IaSQL engine to send a request to AWS for importing the public key.
:::

#### Create And Configure Security Group

Now it's time to launch our EC2 instance. Before we go for the instance itself, let's first define the security group that's going to be attached to it. For this purpose, we'll need [`aws_security_group`](https://iasql.com/docs/modules/aws/aws_security_group/) module. But since `aws_ec2` module depends on it, it's already installed because IaSQL automatically installs the dependencies for modules upon an `iasql_install` call.

<ThemedImage
  alt="aws_ec2 module dependencies"
  style={{ width: '440' }}
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/iasql-on-ec2/module-dependency.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/iasql-on-ec2/module-dependency_dark.png'),
  }}
/>


```sql
WITH sg as (INSERT INTO security_group (description, group_name)
            VALUES ('IaSQL security group', 'iasql_sg')
            RETURNING id)
INSERT
INTO security_group_rule (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description, security_group_id)
VALUES (FALSE, 'tcp', 22, 22, '0.0.0.0/0', 'ssh port is accessible from all ips', (SELECT id FROM sg)),
       (FALSE, 'tcp', 9879, 9879, '<your-ip>/0', 'open dashboard to just me', (SELECT id FROM sg)),
       (FALSE, 'tcp', 5432, 5432, '0.0.0.0/0', 'postgres port is accessible from all ips', (SELECT id FROM sg)),
       (TRUE, 'tcp', 1, 65535, '0.0.0.0/0', 'allow outgoing traffic to anywhere', (SELECT id FROM sg));
```
This query uses a [`WITH` Postgres query](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html) to insert a security group, and then select the `id` of the resulting security group to be re-used in the second `INSERT` query. The `WITH` query can be thought of as a temporary table that exists just for one query. By use of `WITH` we can simplify our query and do the insert, and preloading of the resulting id in a single query. We could've written the query using [subqueries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-subquery.html) as follows, but that way we should've repeated the `SELECT id FROM security_group WHERE ...` part for each set of values (and of course, doing the insert in a separate query):
```sql
INSERT INTO security_group_rule (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description, security_group_id)
VALUES (FALSE, 'tcp', 22, 22, '0.0.0.0/0', 'ssh port is accessible from all ips',
        (SELECT id FROM security_group WHERE group_name = 'iasql_sg')),
       (FALSE, 'tcp', 9879, 9879, '<your-ip>/0', 'open dashboard to just me',
        (SELECT id FROM security_group WHERE group_name = 'iasql_sg')),
       (FALSE, 'tcp', 5432, 5432, '0.0.0.0/0', 'postgres port is accessible from all ips',
        (SELECT id FROM security_group WHERE group_name = 'iasql_sg')),
       (TRUE, 'tcp', 1, 65535, '0.0.0.0/0', 'allow outgoing traffic to anywhere',
        (SELECT id FROM security_group WHERE group_name = 'iasql_sg'));
```
The `security_group_id` column has an FK set to the `security_group` table's `id` column. Therefore, we need to insert the correct `id` for the security group we just created.

:::warning
Since the IaSQL dashboard does not have a default authorization mechanism set, remember to replace `<your-ip>` value in the above queries with your own IP address.

You can find your current IP address by visiting [api.ipify.org](https://api.ipify.org/). Just remember that most internet users don't have a static IP address and your IP address will be changed each time your router reconnects.
:::

#### Launch EC2 Instance

It's now time to actually create the EC2 instance. We'll issue a query as follows to do so:

```sql
INSERT INTO instance (ami, instance_type, subnet_id, tags, user_data, key_pair_name)
VALUES (...);
```

Before we write the query, let's investigate each column in the `instance` table. As you've already noticed, we create AWS resources by `INSERT`ing rows into corresponding tables. For example, we created a security group by executing the `INESRT INTO security_group` query. With that in mind, let's look into the columns of the `instance` table (which is in charge of managing EC2 servers) that will be used in our query:
- `ami`: this column is the [Amazon Machine Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) ID that is used to launch the EC2 server. We can either directly insert the AMI ID (like `ami-0f1a5f5ada0e7da53`), or use a parameter reference to the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (like `resolve:ssm:/aws/service/canonical/ubuntu/server/22.04/stable/current/amd64/hvm/ebs-gp2/ami-id`). We'll go with the parameter reference choice.

:::info
The parameter reference `resolve:ssm:/aws/service/canonical/ubuntu/server/22.04/stable/current/amd64/hvm/ebs-gp2/ami-id` uses the `resolve` syntax to retrieve the value of an [SSM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html) parameter.

The `ssm` service name specifies that the parameter is stored in the [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html). The rest of the path `/aws/service/canonical/ubuntu/server/22.04/stable/current/amd64/hvm/ebs-gp2/ami-id` is the path to the SSM parameter containing the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID for a specific Ubuntu Server 22.04 AMI that is optimized for use with Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) General Purpose SSD volumes.
:::

:::info
[Dynamic References](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/dynamic-references.html) provide a compact, powerful way for you to specify external values that are stored and managed in other AWS services, such as the Systems Manager Parameter Store and AWS Secrets Manager. We use AWS Resolve syntax to dynamically reference a value.

The AWS Resolve syntax uses the following format:
```
resolve:<service-name>:<reference-key>
```
- `service-name`: Specifies the service in which the value is stored and managed. Currently, valid values are `ssm` for AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, `ssm-secure` Systems Manager too, but for secure strings, and `secretsmanager` for AWS Secrets Manager.
- `reference-key`: The reference key. Depending on the type of dynamic reference, the reference key may be comprised of multiple segments. For example when using Systems Manager Parameter Store, this key can be like `parameter-name:version`.

Using the AWS Resolve syntax in AWS SDK, CloudFormation templates or EC2 user data script allows you to dynamically reference and use the values of resources [in other AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html#:~:text=Accessible%20from%20other%20AWS%20services), which can be useful for automating the deployment of AWS resources.

For example, you could use `resolve:ssm:S3AccessControl:2` to reference version `2` of a parameter stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, and `resolve:secretsmanager:MyRDSSecret:SecretString:username` to reference a secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager.
:::

- `instance_type`: this column contains the [instance type](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) of the EC2 server. We'll use a `t2.small` instance for our deployment.
- `subnet_id`: this is a foreign key to `subnet` table based on its `id` column. Good thing about IaSQL is that it'll automatically import every subnet in your cloud environment when you install the `iasql_vpc` module. This is not just for the subnets, but all the resources will be imported when installing the module that manages them. You can also manage the infrastructure outside IaSQL afterwards, having IaSQL also import your subsequent changes to the database. We'll use a `SELECT` query from the `subnet` table to fill this column.
- `tags`: this column is a JSON column. It'll contain all the tags for this instance. We'll use `{"name":"iasql"}` as the value for this column since AWS treats the instance name as a tag.
- `user_data`: when you launch an instance in Amazon EC2, you have the option of passing user data to the instance that can be used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. You can pass two types of user data to Amazon EC2: shell scripts and [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) directives [[1]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html). We'll write the deployment scripts in bash, but it's also possible to pass `cloud-init` directives.
- `key_pair_name`: AWS accepts a key pair for the instance. It can be used to log into the instance through SSH. We'll use the `iasql` key pair we initially created using `key_pair_import` RPC.
- `region`: this column is omitted and therefore will be replaced with the result of `default_aws_region()` Postgres function. we can choose the [AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html#Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.Availability) in which the instance will be launched. IaSQL is already multi-region, which means it'll manage your resources in all the regions. So this additional `region` column can be used to determine which region the instance is in, and while `INSERT`ing used to direct IaSQL to create the instance in that region.

##### Bash Startup Script

Alright, we can now write our query to deploy IaSQL on EC2. Let's write the query with EC2 startup script being a shell script:

```sql
INSERT INTO instance (ami, instance_type, subnet_id, tags, user_data, key_pair_name)
SELECT 'resolve:ssm:/aws/service/canonical/ubuntu/server/22.04/stable/current/amd64/hvm/ebs-gp2/ami-id',
       't2.small',
       subnet.id,
       '{"name":"iasql"}',
       '#!/bin/bash
     sudo apt-get upgrade -y
     sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
     docker run -p 9876:9876 -p 5432:5432 --name iasql iasql/iasql',
       'iasql'
FROM subnet
         INNER JOIN vpc ON vpc.id = subnet.vpc_id
    AND vpc.is_default
WHERE vpc.region = default_aws_region()
LIMIT 1;
```

There's just one last step needed. Remember the security group we created earlier? We never assigned our instance to it (we couldn't because it didn't exist, yet). So let's do it and let IaSQL do the rest:
```sql
INSERT INTO instance_security_groups (instance_id, security_group_id)
SELECT instance.id, security_group.id
FROM instance, security_group
WHERE instance.tags ->> 'name' = 'iasql'
      AND security_group.group_name = 'iasql_sg'
LIMIT 1;
```
The `instance_security_groups` table is a Many-to-Many join table that connects `instance`s to their `security_group`s. Now we need to wait for IaSQL to start syncing the state of the cloud with our local changes. This will normally happen every 2 minutes. There is a way to make the cloud apply/sync happen immediately using [IaSQL transactions](https://iasql.com/docs/transaction/), but for the purpose of this post we'll wait for the next cronjob tick to apply our changes.

After waiting long enough for the server to start and for the startup script to finish, we can use instance's public IP to access our self-hosted IaSQL dashboard:

```sql
SELECT public_ip_address
FROM instance_metadata
WHERE id = (SELECT id
            FROM instance
            WHERE tags ->> 'name' = 'iasql'
            LIMIT 1);
```

Now we can go to `http://<instance-ip>:9876/` URL, and we'll see the beautiful IaSQL dashboard deployed on our EC2 server.

### Enable HTTPS and Connect To A Domain
We're able to access the dashboard by the EC2 instance IP. There are some downsides to this IP-based access, for example we have to connect to the instance using a plaintext HTTP connection. So it's better to polish this setup and:
- Import our domain in Route53
- Issue an SSL certificate for our domain
- Launch an Elastic LoadBalancer and use the issued certificate to respond to incoming HTTPs traffic
- Allow incoming traffic to the instance on port 9876 (dashboard port) only from the load balancer
- Allow incoming traffic on the load balancer only from our IP

This will make the setup very similar to the IaSQL production setup.

<img src='/img/iasql-on-ec2/production-setup.png' />

#### Import Domain In Route53

Let's start with adding our domain to Route53. To be able to manage Route53 resources in IaSQL, we'll first need to install the corresponding module:
```sql
SELECT iasql_install('aws_route53');
```
Alright, now let's `INSERT` a row into the `hosted_zone` table to direct the IaSQL engine to create a new Route53 hosted zone for us.

:::note
To know which tables are supported by the `aws_route53` module, you can visit [`aws_route53` module documentation](https://iasql.com/docs/modules/aws/aws_route53/).
:::

```sql
SELECT iasql_begin();

INSERT INTO hosted_zone (domain_name)
VALUES ('<your-domain>');

SELECT iasql_commit();
```

:::note
Simple `INSERT`, right? But wait! What are those `iasql_begin` and `iasql_commit` functions called before and after our insert command?

Quick answer is that if you need your changes to be applied now instead of eventually in the future, you'll wrap the changes between an `iasql_begin` and an `iasql_commit`. For more info on what they do, visit [our documentation on IaSQL transactions](https://iasql.com/docs/transaction/).
:::

Now that we have created our hosted zone, we need to set our domain's nameservers to the ones that Route53 provides us. For each public hosted zone that you create, Amazon Route53 [automatically creates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/SOA-NSrecords.html) a name server (NS) record and a start of authority (SOA) record. So we need to log into our domain registrar and set the name server values to the four name server values that Route53 has set. How this is done exactly varies from registrar to registrar, but we can get those NS values with a `SELECT` query:
```sql
SELECT record as name_server
FROM resource_record_set
WHERE parent_hosted_zone_id = (SELECT id FROM hosted_zone WHERE domain_name = '<your-domain>')
  AND record_type = 'NS';
```
After updating the name servers in the domain settings, we need to wait for those values to be propagated. This can happen in minutes, or even up to 48 hours depending on the registrar.


:::note
You can find out which NS records are accessible from your DNS with the [`dig` command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig):

```sh
dig <your-domain> ns
```

It should look something like this when ready:

```sh
$ dig skybase.dev ns

#### Issue An SSL Certificate For Our Domain
Having the domain setup in Route53, it's easy to use IaSQL's `certificate_request` RPC to issue a new certificate for it. If you try to go with this procedure through AWS console, you'll need to manually add the CNAME records from the AWS ACM to your hosted zone. But this RPC is implemented in a way that automagically [sets the DNS records](https://github.com/alantech/iasql/blob/v0.1.7/src/modules/aws_acm/rpcs/request.ts#L177-L188), [waits for the certificate to be issued](https://github.com/alantech/iasql/blob/v0.1.7/src/modules/aws_acm/rpcs/request.ts#L197), and then [removes those validation DNS records](https://github.com/alantech/iasql/blob/v0.1.7/src/modules/aws_acm/rpcs/request.ts#L200).

```sql
-- SELECT iasql_install('aws_acm'); -- no need for this because aws_route53 depends on it and it's automatically installed
SELECT certificate_request('<your-domain>', 'DNS', default_aws_region(), '{}');

-- inspect the new certificate
SELECT *
FROM certificate
WHERE domain_name = '<your-domain>' AND status = 'ISSUED';
```

The second query confirms that we have a new certificate for our domain, and it's ready to be used (status = `ISSUED`). Now we're ready to launch our load balancer, listen for HTTPS traffic with this new certificate, and forward the incoming traffic to our EC2 instance's 9876 port.

#### Spawn An Elastic Load Balancer
To set up an elastic load balancer, we need the following resources:
- `load_balancer` itself
- A `target_group` pointing to our EC2 instance on port 9876
- A `listener` on port 443 of the load balancer

You know the drill: we `INSERT` rows in the corresponding tables, and IaSQL will apply our desired changes to the cloud (remember to replace `<your-ip>` with your own public IP address).

First, we create a new security group for our load balancer that should allow traffic on 443 port only from our IP (while allowing outgoing traffic from our load balancer):
```sql
INSERT INTO security_group (description, group_name, region)
VALUES ('allows traffic on 443 port from my ip', 'iasql-lb', default_aws_region());

WITH lb_security_group as (SELECT id FROM security_group WHERE group_name = 'iasql-lb')
INSERT
INTO security_group_rule (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description, security_group_id, region)
VALUES (false, 'tcp', 443, 443, '<your-ip>/32', 'allow incoming traffic on 443 from my ip',
        (SELECT id FROM lb_security_group), default_aws_region()),
       (true, 'tcp', 1, 65535, '0.0.0.0/32', 'allow outgoing traffic from load balancer',
        (SELECT id FROM lb_security_group), default_aws_region());
```

Then perform creation of the actual load balancer, the target group, and the listener:
```sql
INSERT INTO load_balancer (load_balancer_name, scheme, load_balancer_type, ip_address_type, region)
VALUES ('iasql-lb', 'internet-facing', 'application', 'ipv4', default_aws_region());

INSERT INTO target_group (target_group_name, target_type, protocol, port)
VALUES ('iasql', 'instance', 'HTTPS', 9876);

INSERT INTO listener (load_balancer_id, port, protocol, target_group_id)
VALUES ((SELECT id FROM load_balancer WHERE load_balancer_name = 'iasql-lb'), 443, 'HTTPS',
        (SELECT id FROM target_group WHERE target_group_name = 'iasql'));
```

And do not forget to assign the security group to our load balancer:
```sql
INSERT INTO load_balancer_security_groups (load_balancer_id, security_group_id)
SELECT (SELECT id FROM load_balancer WHERE load_balancer_name = 'iasql-lb'),
       (SELECT id FROM security_group WHERE group_name = 'iasql-lb');
```

The only step remaining is to allow incoming traffic to our instance on port 9876 only from our load balancer:
```sql
UPDATE security_group_rule
SET source_security_group = (SELECT id FROM security_group WHERE group_name = 'iasql-lb'),
    cidr_ipv4             = NULL
WHERE cidr_ipv4 = '<my-ip>';
```
(we're basically updating the previous rule that allowed direct access from our IP to no longer allow direct access and instead only allow access from load balancer security group)

Waiting for enough time for the above changes to be propagated to the cloud, the load balancer should be up and listening on a DNS name:
```sql
SELECT dns_name FROM load_balancer WHERE load_balancer_name = 'iasql-lb'
```

Finally, we will create a CNAME record pointing to that load balancer that will make IaSQL working under our domain name:
```sql
INSERT INTO resource_record_set (name, record_type, record, ttl, parent_hosted_zone_id)
VALUES ('<your-domain>', 'CNAME', (SELECT dns_name FROM load_balancer WHERE load_balancer_name = 'iasql-lb'), 300,
        (SELECT id FROM hosted_zone WHERE domain_name = '<your-domain>'))
```
Now you (and only you) can access IaSQL dashboard by simply visiting `https://<your-domain>/`!
