Did you know you can deploy a static website without leaving your SQL REPL? So you need to create a S3 bucket, shove the HTML files into it, enable S3 static website hosting, add a CloudFront distribution to support HTTPS, and maybe also connect it to a domain on Route53? Seems a big checklist to tackle, even when doing through the AWS dashboard with all the UI it provides. Follow this post, and I'll show you how to deploy any static website with just SQL commands by leveraging IaSQL powers.

## Create a S3 Bucket
```sql TheButton
INSERT INTO bucket (name, policy_document) VALUES ('my-iasql-static-website', '{}');
```
