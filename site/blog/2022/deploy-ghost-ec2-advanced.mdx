# Advanced configuration for deploying <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> on EC2

In our previous <a href="https://iasql.com/blog/deploy-ghost-ec2/">blogpost</a> we showed how to install <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> in an EC2 instance, using a simple configuration. While it is ok
for testing and development purposes, it was not ready for production. In order to be ready, it needs some essential features, that we will be illustrating on this new post.

## Associate a domain

The initial deployment was just serving Ghost on the public IP of the instance, which is something not suitable for end use. As an initial step, we will be associating that instance with a domain.
In order to achieve that, we will be relying on AWS Route 53 to create hosted zones and recordsets, and associate them to the instance:

```sql TheButton[Generate A record for domain]="Generate A record for domain"
 -- Install modules
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_install ('aws_route53');

SELECT * FROM iasql_begin();
INSERT INTO hosted_zone (domain_name) VALUES ('test-ghost.com.');
INSERT INTO resource_record_set (name, parent_hosted_zone_id, record_type, record, ttl) 
select 'blog.test-ghost.com.', id , 'A', '<instance_public_ip>', 300
from hosted_zone where domain_name='test-ghost.com.';
SELECT * FROM iasql_commit();
```

After some period of time, and assuming that the domain is properly pointing to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-in-use.html#migrate-dns-change-name-servers-with-provider">AWS nameservers</a>,
the domain should be pointing to the EC2 instance.

Finally, Ghost needs to be configured to serve this new domain. This can be achieved by connecting by SSH to the instance:

```console
ssh ubuntu@<instance_public_ip>
sudo su ghostuser
cd /var/www/ghost
ghost config url http://blog.test-ghost.com
ghost setup nginx
ghost restart
```

## Serve traffic over HTTPS

The current deployment is served as HTTP, something not really suitable for production, where all traffic needs to be served via HTTPS. In order to achieve that, we can request a certificate for the
domain using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager">AWS ACM</a> functionality. The certificate will be validated automatically using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html">DNS method</a>:

```sql TheButton[Request certificate and validate via DNS]="Request certificate and validate via DNS"
 -- Install modules
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_install ('aws_acm');

-- request certificate
SELECT * FROM certificate_request('test-ghost.com', 'DNS', 'us-east-2', '');
```

The DNS method needs that the domain is managed via Route 53 service. As an alternative, manual validation can be issued via e-mail. In this case, a validation link will be sent to the associated e-mail for the domain. The certificate will be activated
by manually clicking on the activation link:

```sql TheButton[Request certificate and validate via email]="Request certificate and validate via email"
 -- Install modules
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_install ('aws_acm');

-- request certificate
SELECT * FROM certificate_request('test-ghost.com', 'EMAIL', 'us-east-2', '');
```

Once the certificate has been properly issued, it needs to be associated with the current EC2 instance. This is achieved by creating a
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Load Balancer</a> - application, internet facing - and properly associating the certificate and domain:

```sql TheButton[Create Load Balancer]="Create Load Balancer"
 -- Install modules
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_install ('aws_elb');

-- create components
select * from iasql_begin();
INSERT INTO load_balancer (load_balancer_name, scheme, vpc, load_balancer_type, ip_address_type)
VALUES ('ghost', 'internet-facing', null, 'application', 'ipv4');
INSERT INTO load_balancer_security_groups(load_balancer_id, security_group_id)
SELECT (SELECT id FROM load_balancer WHERE load_balancer_name = 'ghost'),
        (SELECT id FROM security_group WHERE group_name = 'ghost_sg');

INSERT INTO target_group (target_group_name, target_type, protocol, port)
VALUES ('ghost', 'instance', 'HTTP', 80);

INSERT INTO listener (load_balancer_id, port, protocol, target_group_id, action_type, certificate_id) VALUES
((SELECT id FROM load_balancer WHERE load_balancer_name = 'ghost'), 443, 'HTTPS',
(SELECT id FROM target_group WHERE target_group_name = 'ghost'), 'forward',
(SELECT id FROM certificate WHERE domain_name='test-ghost.com'));

select * from iasql_commit();
```

Once the ALB is created, we will associate the Ghost EC2 instance with the matching target group:

```sql TheButton[Associate instance to target group]="Associate instance to target group"
select * from iasql_begin();
INSERT INTO registered_instance (instance, target_group_id)
SELECT (SELECT id FROM instance WHERE tags ->> 'name' = 'ghost-blog'), (SELECT id FROM target_group WHERE target_group_name = 'ghost');

select * from iasql_commit();
```

The final step is to point the domain to the load balancer that has been created. If the domain is managed via Route 53 it
can be setup automatically:

```sql TheButton[Create recordset]="Create recordset"
select * from iasql_begin();
delete from resource_record_set where name='blog.test-ghost.com.';
insert into resource_record_set (name, record_type, record, ttl, parent_hosted_zone_id) values ('blog.test-ghost.com.', 'A', (select dns_name from load_balancer where load_balancer_name='ghost'),
(select id from hosted_zone where domain_name='test-ghost.com.'));
select * from iasql_commit();
```

If the domain is managed externally, please create an A record with the domain of the blogpost, pointing to the DNS name of the created Load Balancer.

After the components have been created and instance properly associated, the Ghost configuration can be changed accordingly:

```console
ssh ubuntu@<instance_public_ip>
sudo su ghostuser
cd /var/www/ghost
ghost config url https://blog.test-ghost.com
ghost setup nginx
ghost restart
```
