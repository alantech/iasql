# Deploy <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> to AWS with one click

Ghost is a powerful app for new-media creators to publish, share, and grow a business around their content. It comes with modern tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters & offer paid
subscriptions to members.

Ghost is a software as a service product, but it is built totally on open source and offers a self-hosted, self-serve version. This version can be hosted on AWS using several approaches, and one of them.

Starting an EC2 instance and manually triggering the installation commands is a procedure that can be done manually, but there are also another dependencies involved, such as the creation of proper security groups.
It is time-consuming task, specially if you need to install several instances. This article will offer a way to install Ghost with one-click on IaSQL using an EC2 instance on Ubuntu as highlighted <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/">here</a>.

_This approach uses <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html">EC2 user data</a> functionality - to run an startup script that will configure Ghost
as soon as the instance is started - and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html">EC2 instance metadata</a> - to retrieve
the public IP of the instance, and assign it dynamically to Ghost installation script._

```sql TheButton[Install Ghost]="Install Ghost"

  iasql_install ('aws_ec2', 'aws_ec2_metadata');

-- start transaction

  AND vpc.is_default = 'Y'
WHERE
  vpc.region = 'us-east-2'
  AND subnet.availability_zone = 'us-east-2a'

-- insert instance security groups
INSERT INTO
  instance_security_groups (instance_id, security_group_id)
SELECT
  (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      instance
    WHERE
      tags ->> 'name' = 'ghost-blog'
    LIMIT
      1
  ),
  (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      security_group
    WHERE
      group_name = 'ghost_sg'
      AND region = 'us-east-2'
    LIMIT
      1
  );

SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_commit();
```

After the process finishes (it will take over 10-15 minutes), you will have your Ghost instance installed, publicly accessible through the public IP of the spinned instance.
You can get the details of the public IP of your instance querying for the metadata:

```sql
SELECT
  public_ip_address
FROM
  instance_metadata
WHERE
  id = (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      instance
    WHERE
      tags ->> 'name' = 'ghost-blog'
    LIMIT
      1
  );
```

The initial Ghost installation will be available on the browser just query by `http://<public_ip_address>/ghost`:

This is the basic installation of Ghost, but it is just meant for development and testing purposes. Once you are satisfied with the setup,
you can continue to an advanced deployment of Ghost meant for production. This will come in a follow-up post from IaSQL.
