# Securely connect Amazon RDS using PrivateLink

<p>Do you have some database instances on RDS and wonder what's the most secure way to reach them?</p>
<p>
  While RDS endpoints can be reached from public internet, you should consider accessing them internally from
  your VPC, to grant additional security to those services that are critical.
</p>
<p>
  AWS PrivateLink offers the possibility to securely access those services without exposing them to internet,
  just using Amazon's private network.

## Testing the result

<p>
  in order to start testing the result, you can start a new EC2 instance on a private VPC, on the same region
  where your RDS and Endpoint interface is configured. You can double check that there is no internet
  connectivity. But the RDS endpoint could still be reached, by using the interface that has been created:

</div>

<p>
  Please note that you could only use those endpoints from the same region. You could reach the services in a
  multi-region way with the use of{' '}
