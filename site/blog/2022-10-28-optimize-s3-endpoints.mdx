# Optimize your S3 endpoints for cost and efficiency

Are you using S3 buckets as part of your cloud deployments? How are you accessing them?

When not configured properly, access to the S3 buckets may need to be accessed over the public internet. One simple but costly way
is to rely on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_en/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html" target="_blank">NAT gateways</a>.

But there is a more optimal solution, that is creating <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html"
target="_blank">gateway or interface VPC endpoints</a> for each region where you have buckets exposed.

When the VPC endpoints are enabled you can access your S3 buckets using this endpoint. This will allow you
to control your buckets from an internal network with the desired security, and without the extra costs of a
NAT gateway.

### Why use VPC Interface Endpoints

AWS VPC Interface Endpoints are a component of AWS's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink">PrivateLink</a> infrastructure. AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between virtual private clouds (VPCs),
supported AWS services, and your on-premises networks without exposing your traffic to the public internet.

Relying on PrivateLink offers a set of advantages in terms of **security** and **performance**.

**Security: no internet traversal**

When deploying services in production, the concept of defense-in-depth is essential: have an information
assurance strategy that provides multiple, redundant defensive measures in case a security control fails or
a vulnerability is exploited.
By using interface endpoints the services will be accessed via Amazon's internal networks. It is an essential
security measure, that will prevent attackers to directly reach the services by keeping them in a private
network, reducing the surface area of attack.

**Security: policies**

AWS services can benefit of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_controlling.html">IAM policies</a>
to perform a fine grained access control. When using interface endpoints, those policies can be applied to determine the traffic
that can pass through the interface.

**Performance: latency**

Because of the traffic staying within Amazon’s networks, the physical distance travelled, the number of hops
and the risk of traversing congested networks are all significantly lower.

**Performance: bandwidth**

PrivateLink supports a sustained bandwidth of 10 Gbps per availability zone with bursts up to 40 Gbps.

**Performance: stability**

PrivateLink consistently lowers the amount of errors and timeouts on high loads. As the traffic over Private Link stays within
Amazon’s networks, it means a reduction on distance travelled, number of hops, and the risk of traversing congested networks.

In terms of speed, Private Link supports a sustained bandwidth of 10 Gbps per availability zone with bursts up to 40 Gbps.

**Do you want to know if you have it properly configured? The following query will check for active S3 VPC interface endpoints:**

This query will find your active S3 buckets for all regions, associated with the existing endpoint gateways or interfaces - if they exist.

```sql
 -- Installing the needed modules
SELECT
  iasql_install ('aws_s3');

SELECT
  iasql_install ('aws_vpc');

-- Perform the query for endpoints
SELECT
  bucket.region,
  vpc.is_default,
  vpc.cidr_block,
  (
    SELECT
      COUNT(*) > 0
    FROM
      endpoint_gateway
    WHERE
      endpoint_gateway.region = bucket.region
      AND service = 's3'
      AND endpoint_gateway.vpc_id = vpc.id
  ) AS has_endpoint_gateway,
  (
    SELECT
      COUNT(*) > 0
    FROM
      endpoint_interface
    WHERE
      endpoint_interface.region = bucket.region
      AND service = 's3'
      AND endpoint_interface.vpc_id = vpc.id
  ) AS has_endpoint_interface
FROM
  bucket
  LEFT OUTER JOIN vpc ON vpc.region = bucket.region;

Have you found missing endpoints? No problem, IaSQL can generate them for you. You can create two different
types of endpoints: gateway and interface. We're going to describe their main features and you can create
the desired type in an automated way.

## Interface endpoints

An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address that serves as an entry
point for traffic destined to a supported AWS service. As they use ENIs, they can benefit from security groups
to control traffic. Policies can also be added to control access to those endpoints.

They are regional, meaning they can only be accessed by the same region they are created. However, Multi-region is possible by also using VPC peering, so resources in one region can be accessed from others, though this only supports IPv4
TCP traffic.

An interface endpoint (except S3 interface endpoint) has a corresponding private DNS hostname, that can be
used to access the resource.

Interface endpoints cover a wide range of services such as S3, Lambda, API Gateway, etc... <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html">

This query will auto-generate the missing interface endpoints and will preview the changes to be applied on your cloud. Simply uncomment the final statement and run it to make the changes to your cloud account.

```sql
 -- Inserts the missing endpoints
INSERT INTO
  endpoint_interface (region, vpc_id, service)
SELECT
  bucket.region,
  vpc.id,
  's3'
FROM
  bucket
  INNER JOIN vpc ON bucket.region = vpc.region
WHERE
  NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      endpoint_interface
    WHERE
      endpoint_interface.region = bucket.region
      AND endpoint_interface.vpc_id = vpc.id
  );

-- Preview the changes
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_preview_apply ();

-- Apply the changes
--select * from iasql_apply();

## Endpoint gateways

An endpoint gateway is a gateway that can be configured as a target for a route in your route table, used
to access traffic in DynamoDB or S3

Multiple gateway endpoints can be created in a single VPC, and those can be used on different route tables
to enforce different access policies from different subnets to the same service.

Gateway endpoints are supported within the same region only, resources from multiple regions cannot be
accssed, even using VPC peering. They also support IPv4 traffic only.

In order to use them, DNS resolution must be enabled in the VPC.

When a route is added, all instances in the subnets associated with the route table will automatically
use the endpoint to access the service.

Gateway endpoints only support S3 and DynamoDB services. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/gateway-endpoints.html">Get more detail about gateway endpoints</a>.

This query will auto-generate the missing endpoint gateways and will allow you to preview the changes to be applied on your cloud.

```sql
 -- Inserts the missing endpoints
INSERT INTO
  endpoint_gateway (region, vpc_id, service)
SELECT
  bucket.region,
  vpc.id,
  's3'
FROM
  bucket
  INNER JOIN vpc ON bucket.region = vpc.region
WHERE
  NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      endpoint_gateway
    WHERE
      endpoint_gateway.region = bucket.region
      AND endpoint_gateway.vpc_id = vpc.id
  )
  -- Preview the changes
SELECT
  *
FROM
  iasql_preview_apply ();

## Testing the result

Once all the relevant endpoints have been created, you can confirm your access to the gateway endpoints from an internal EC2 instance on the same region as the endpoint you want to test:

For interface endpoints, access also can be tested using the named endpoint:
