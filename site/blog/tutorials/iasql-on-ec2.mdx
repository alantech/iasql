title: Deploy IaSQL on EC2 using IaSQL

We're intending to publish a series of blog posts on deploying different services using IaSQL. IaSQL covers a wide range of AWS services, so there are lots of possibilities to explore. You can deploy containers to ECS, launch servers using EC2, and have CodePipelines that take the burden of building and deploying your applications.

In this post we'll explore how to deploy IaSQL on EC2, using IaSQL!

### Start IaSQL
To start using IaSQL capabilities, we'll need to run a local version of IaSQL:
```bash
docker run -p 9876:9876 -p 5432:5432 --name iasql iasql/iasql
```
This will download the latest IaSQL image from DockerHub and run it. After it's ready, you can access the dashboard at the following URL:
```
http://localhost:9876/
```

Now you can connect your AWS account in the dashboard. This will create a new database for you which you can connect to it using any Postgres client, or run your queries on it through the dashboard.

If you'd prefer to use a hosted version, and not to run a local version of IaSQL, you can visit [app.iasql.com](https://app.iasql.com/) to use our SaaS solution.

### Deploy IaSQL on EC2 with IaSQL
Let's begin by taking an overview of what we're going to do to give you a general idea of the parts that are going to be deployed, before we move on to explore the specifics.

To deploy IaSQL on EC2, we need to:

- Launch an EC2 instance that will host IaSQL
- Set the EC2 user data so that Docker will be installed upon instance launch, and the IaSQL container will be started
- Import an SSH key pair into AWS to be able to access the EC2 instance afterwards
- Set a security group for the instance to allow SSH, while disallowing unauthorized access to the dashboard

{diagram here}

Let's start by installing the needed IaSQL modules. IaSQL has a modular design, and therefore to manage EC2 instances, we need to use [`aws_ec2` module](https://iasql.com/docs/modules/aws/aws_ec2/. Also, [`aws_ec2_metadata`](https://iasql.com/docs/modules/aws/aws_ec2_metadata/) allows us to get more info on our EC2 instance, like its public IP.
```sql
SELECT * FROM iasql_install('aws_ec2', 'aws_ec2_metadata');
```

If you want to be able to access the instance through SSH, you can import your public key into AWS by executing the following IaSQL RPC:
```sql
SELECT * FROM key_pair_import('iasql', '<your-public-key-content>', 'us-east-1');
```

This will direct IaSQL to create an [AWS key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html#how-to-generate-your-own-key-and-import-it-to-aws) with the name `iasql` in the `us-east-1` region, and with your public key contents.

:::note
An IaSQL RPC is a function defined in Postgres that upon calling, sends a request to the IaSQL engine to run a pre-define logic and returns results to the Postgres console. In the above example [`key_pair_import`](https://iasql.com/docs/modules/aws/tables/aws_ec2_rpcs_import.KeyPairImportRpc/) is an IaSQL RPC that triggers the IaSQL engine to send a request to AWS for importing the public key.
:::

Now it's time to launch our EC2 instance. Before we go for the instance itself, let's first define the security group that's going to be attached to it. For this purpose, we'll need [`aws_security_group`](https://iasql.com/docs/modules/aws/aws_security_group/) module. But since `aws_ec2` module depends on it, it's already installed because IaSQL automatically installs the dependencies for modules upon an `iasql_install` call.

<img src={"/img/module-dependency.png"} alt={"aws_ec2 module dependencies"} />

```sql
INSERT INTO security_group (description, group_name)
VALUES ('IaSQL security group', 'iasql_sg');

INSERT INTO security_group_rule (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description, security_group_id)
SELECT t.is_egress,
       t.ip_protocol,
       t.from_port,
       t.to_port,
       t.cidr_ipv4::cidr,
       t.description,
       security_group.id
FROM security_group,
     (VALUES (FALSE, 'tcp', 22, 22, '0.0.0.0/0', 'ssh port is accessible from all ips'),
             (FALSE, 'tcp', 9879, 9879, '<your-ip>/0', 'open dashboard to just me'),
             (FALSE, 'tcp', 5432, 5432, '0.0.0.0/0', 'postgres port is accessible from all ips'),
             (TRUE, 'tcp', 1, 65535, '0.0.0.0/0',
              'allow outgoing traffic to anywhere')) AS t (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description)
WHERE security_group.group_name = 'iasql_sg';
```
The first query simply creates a security group named `iasql_sg`. The second query seems a bit hard at the first sight, but it can be re-written as multiple `INSERT` queries:
```sql
INSERT INTO security_group_rule (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description, security_group_id)
VALUES (FALSE, 'tcp', 22, 22, '0.0.0.0/0', 'ssh port is accessible from all ips',
        (SELECT id FROM security_group WHERE group_name = 'iasql_sg'));
```
The reason we've written it that way is to avoid repeating the inner `SELECT id FROM security_group` query four times. The `security_group_id` column has an FK set to the `security_group` table's `id` column. Therefore, we need to insert the correct `id` for the security group we just created.

Since the IaSQL dashboard does not have a default authorization mechanism set, remember to replace `<your-ip>` value in the above queries with your own IP address.

:::info
You can find your current IP address by visiting [api.ipify.org](https://api.ipify.org/). Just remember that most internet users don't have a static IP address and your IP address will be changed each time your router reconnects.
:::

It's now time to actually create the EC2 instance. We'll issue a query as follows to do so:

```sql
INSERT INTO instance (ami, instance_type, subnet_id, tags, user_data, key_pair_name, region)
VALUES (...);
```

Before we write the query, let's investigate each column in the `instance` table. As you've already noticed, we create AWS resources by `INSERT`ing rows into corresponding tables. For example, we created a security group by executing the `INESRT INTO security_group` query. With that in mind, let's look into the columns of the `instance` table (which is in charge of managing EC2 servers) that will be used in our query:
- `ami`: this column is the [Amazon Machine Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) ID that is used to launch the EC2 server. We can either directly insert the AMI ID (like `ami-0f1a5f5ada0e7da53`), or use a parameter reference to the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (like `resolve:ssm:/aws/service/canonical/ubuntu/server/22.04/stable/current/amd64/hvm/ebs-gp2/ami-id`). We'll go with the parameter reference choice.

:::info
The parameter reference `resolve:ssm:/aws/service/canonical/ubuntu/server/22.04/stable/current/amd64/hvm/ebs-gp2/ami-id` uses the `resolve` syntax to retrieve the value of an [SSM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html) parameter.

The `ssm` protocol specifies that the parameter is stored in the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. The rest of the path `/aws/service/canonical/ubuntu/server/22.04/stable/current/amd64/hvm/ebs-gp2/ami-id` is the path to the SSM parameter containing the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID for a specific Ubuntu Server 22.04 AMI that is optimized for use with Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) General Purpose SSD volumes.
:::

:::info
AWS Resolve syntax is a feature that allows you to retrieve and use the values of AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters, AWS Secrets Manager secrets, and Amazon S3 bucket objects in AWS SDK and Amazon EC2 user data scripts.

The AWS Resolve syntax uses the following format:
```
resolve:<protocol>:<value>
```
- `protocol`: Specifies the type of resource that is being referenced. The currently supported protocols are `ssm` for AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, `secretsmanager` for AWS Secrets Manager secrets, and `s3` for Amazon S3 bucket objects.
- `value`: Specifies the path to the resource that is being referenced.

Using the AWS Resolve syntax in AWS SDK or EC2 user data script allows you to dynamically reference and use the values of resources in other AWS services, which can be useful for automating the deployment of AWS resources.

For example, you could use `resolve:ssm:/my/parameter/path` to reference a parameter stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, `resolve:secretsmanager:/my/secret/path` to reference a secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager, or `resolve:s3:/my/bucket/path/myobject.txt` to reference an object stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.
:::

- `instance_type`: this column contains the [instance type](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) of the EC2 server. We'll use a `t2.small` instance for our deployment.
- `subnet_id`: this is a foreign key to `subnet` table based on its `id` column. Good thing about IaSQL is that it'll automatically import every subnet in your cloud environment when you install the `iasql_vpc` module. This is not just for the subnets, but all the resources will be imported when installing the module that manages them. You can also manage the infrastructure outside IaSQL afterwards, having IaSQL also import your subsequent changes to the database. We'll use a `SELECT` query from the `subnet` table to fill this column.
- `tags`: this column is a JSON column. It'll contain all the tags for this instance. We'll use `{"name":"iasql"}` as the value for this column since AWS treats the instance name as a tag.
- `user_data`: when you launch an instance in Amazon EC2, you have the option of passing user data to the instance that can be used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. You can pass two types of user data to Amazon EC2: shell scripts and [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) directives [[1]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html). We'll write the deployment scripts in both of those types to demonstrate, and to have more fun!
- `key_pair_name`: AWS accepts a key pair for the instance. It can be used to log into the instance through SSH. We'll use the `iasql` key pair we initially created using `key_pair_import` RPC.
- `region`: we can choose the [AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html#Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.Availability) in which the instance will be launched. IaSQL is already multi-region, which means it'll manage your resources in all the regions. So this additional `region` column can be used to determine which region the instance is in, and while `INSERT`ing used to direct IaSQL to create the instance in that region.

Alright, we can now write our query to deploy IaSQL on EC2. Let's first write the query with EC2 startup script being a shell script, and then write the query with same functionality using [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) directives.

```sql
INSERT INTO instance (ami, instance_type, subnet_id, tags, user_data, key_pair_name, region)
SELECT 'resolve:ssm:/aws/service/canonical/ubuntu/server/22.04/stable/current/amd64/hvm/ebs-gp2/ami-id',
       't2.small',
       subnet.id,
       '{"name":"iasql"}',
       '#!/bin/bash
     curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
     sudo apt-get upgrade -y
     sudo sh get-docker.sh
     docker run -p 9876:9876 -p 5432:5432 --name iasql iasql/iasql
     ',
       'iasql',
       'us-east-1'
FROM subnet
         INNER JOIN vpc ON vpc.id = subnet.vpc_id
    AND vpc.is_default
WHERE vpc.region = 'us-east-1'
  AND subnet.availability_zone = 'us-east-1a'
LIMIT 1;
```

There's just one last step needed. Remember the security group we created earlier? We never assigned our instance to it. So let's do it and let IaSQL do the rest:
```sql
INSERT INTO instance_security_groups (instance_id, security_group_id)
SELECT (SELECT id
        FROM instance
        WHERE tags ->> 'name' = 'iasql'
        LIMIT 1),
       (SELECT id
        FROM security_group
        WHERE group_name = 'iasql_sg'
        LIMIT 1);
```
The `instace_security_groups` table is a Many-to-Many join table that connects `instance`s to their `security_group`s. Now we need to wait for IaSQL to start syncing the state of the cloud with our local changes. This will normally happen every 2 minutes. There is a way to make the cloud apply/sync happen immediately using [IaSQL transactions](https://iasql.com/docs/transaction/), but for the purpose of this post we'll wait for the next cronjob tick to apply our changes.

After waiting long enough for the server to start and for the startup script to finish, we can use instance's public IP to access our self-hosted IaSQL dashboard:

```sql
SELECT public_ip_address
FROM instance_metadata
WHERE id = (SELECT id
            FROM instance
            WHERE tags ->> 'name' = 'iasql'
            LIMIT 1);
```

Now we can go to `http://<instance-ip>:9876/` URL, and we'll see the beautiful IaSQL dashboard deployed on our EC2 server.

### TODO: add cloud-init script.

### Next Steps
In this post, we deployed IaSQL on EC2 server with just using IaSQL and PostgreSQL queries. We'll continue this post with example deployments of other famous apps from now on. Deploying them won't be any harder than this one!
